# Word-Frequency-Counter
Write a program WordCounter.java that reads a text file and counts the number of times each word appears. Your program should then output words that are used more often than some threshold value given by the user. To avoid boring results, compare against the provided list commonwords.txt of the 100 most commonly used words in the English language.
